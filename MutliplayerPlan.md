# Multiplayer Plan
## Overall Idea
The main idea of the multiplayer aspect of the game will be to allow for the player to connect to a server, and work with other players that are connected too, to get as many clicks as possible, all players will share the clicks variable, but each player's upgrades will be personal to them, this means that the player will have to spend the public clicks for their own personal upgrades.

## Networking
The multiplayer will use the Socket library for python to allow for them to connect to the server, and host their own servers for players to connect to. This means that the player will need the information of the server to allow them to connect properly. To allow for all connected players to all share the same amount of clicks, the game will use a queue system, so isntead of all of the users clicking upgrade, and getting the upgrade they want, the server puts that player at the back of the queue, the server then loops through each player, checks if the upgrade can be afforded, if they can't, dont do anything, but if they can, return a message to the user giving them the upgrade, and reducing the clicks amount by the correct amount. Of course the main downside to this method is that the players may have some lag when purchasing upgrades due to the queuing system, but would only really be the case for servers with larger player counts, where the host should be using faster hardware anyways.
### Security conecerns
The main concerns that I have for the online system in the game is the fact that the client and server connect directly to each other, which puts the server and the client at risk of eachother. There are a few ways that I can get around this problem, number one being that the server is port forwarded, which allows for the host to not need to give out their personal IP adress in order to have people connect, which would be paired alongside encrypting the data that is sent, so the client and server can't intersect the data being sent, and find personal information about the clients or the host of the server.
